<h3>Hi, my name is Michael,</h3>

I am a third-year **Bachelor of Information** student at the University of Toronto. As an aspiring software developer currently studying at the University of Toronto and working at IBM as a Technical Software Sales Intern, it's clear that I have always had an interest in tech. Whether it's the latest gaming console or a breakthrough in AI, I'm always looking for new ways to explore and learn about the world of technology around me.
